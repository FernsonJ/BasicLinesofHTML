  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Let's Try this out!</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In the P Tag, I will try to make it more better than numbering it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is number 1</li>
    <li>This is number 2</li>
    <li>This is number 3</li>
    <li>This is number 4</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now We are going to do it without any.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Probably, this is might be new to me.</li>
      <li>Maybe the unordered list works.</li>
      <li>Alright probably this might be the last one.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Now We are going to try the last tag I know.</p>
    <li>By It self without anything related to it.</li>
    <li>Maybe It's Just Bold Pointed Instead.</li>
